"""
Watchdog supervisor for MCP server lifecycle management.

This supervisor process maintains a stable stdio connection with VS Code
while managing ephemeral MCP server child processes. It enables autonomous
server restarts without breaking the MCP protocol initialization handshake.

Exit Codes:
- 0: Clean shutdown (supervisor exits)
- 42: Restart request (supervisor spawns new child)
- >0: Crash (supervisor spawns new child with crash recovery)
