"""RED tests for PhaseStateEngine workflow validation.

Issue #50 - Step 3: PhaseStateEngine Integration

Tests workflow-based phase transition validation:
- Valid sequential transitions (allowed by workflow)
- Invalid transitions (rejected by workflow validation)
- Force transitions (bypass validation with skip_reason)
