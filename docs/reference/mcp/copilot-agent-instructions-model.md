# Copilot Agent Instructions Model

**Status:** DEFINITIVE
**Version:** 1.1
**Last Updated:** 2026-05-17

---

## Purpose

This document explains in one place how the GitHub Copilot instruction files and the
`phase-gate-mcp` server cooperate to enforce workflow discipline in VS Code. It is intended
for developers, integrators, and any AI agent starting fresh on this project.

After reading this document you will understand:
- which instruction files exist and what each one does
- how VS Code decides what to inject into a chat session
- where the `phase-gate-mcp` server fits into that flow
- how `phase_instructions` and `sub_role_hint` from `get_work_context` override static
  instructions at runtime
- what the three-agent model looks like and why the tools are restricted the way they are

## Scope

**In Scope:**
- VS Code instruction primitive hierarchy and loading mechanics
- Project-specific file roles (`AGENTS.md`, `.agent.md` files)
- Three-agent model (`@co`, `@imp`, `@qa`) and tool restrictions
- `get_work_context` integration: `phase_instructions` and `sub_role_hint`
- Context loading order per session type
- Design decisions

**Out of Scope:**
- MCP tool API details \u2014 see [tools/README.md][tools-ref]
- Phase-gate enforcement internals (EnforcementRunner, contracts.yaml) \u2014 see [mcp_vision_reference.md][vision-ref]
- Git workflow mechanics \u2014 see [GIT_WORKFLOW.md][git-workflow]

## Prerequisites

Read these first:
1. [mcp_vision_reference.md][vision-ref] \u2014 what the MCP server is and why it exists
2. [AGENTS.md][agents-md] \u2014 single always-on instruction file

---

## 1. VS Code Instruction Primitive Hierarchy

GitHub Copilot in VS Code supports several instruction primitives. They differ in when they
are loaded and what they are for.

| Primitive | File pattern | When loaded | Purpose |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|---------|
| **Agent instructions** | `AGENTS.md` or `copilot-instructions.md` | **Always** \u2014 every chat interaction | Workspace-wide standards |
| **Custom agent** | `.github/agents/*.agent.md` | On demand \u2014 when that `@agent` is invoked | Role-specific persona, tools, startup |
| **File instructions** | `.github/instructions/*.instructions.md` | When file matches `applyTo:` glob | File-type or folder-specific guidelines |
| **Prompts** | `.github/prompts/*.prompt.md` | On demand \u2014 when invoked as `/command` | Single focused task with parameters |

### 1.1 Agent Instructions (Always-On)

Microsoft documents two file choices \u2014 use exactly one:

| File | Location | VS Code precedence | Generation |
|------|----------|--------------------|-----------|
| `AGENTS.md` | repo root | **Higher** \u2014 checked first | New (VS Code 1.99, April 2025) |
| `copilot-instructions.md` | `.github/` | Lower \u2014 fallback | Legacy (GitHub.com origin) |

**This project uses `AGENTS.md` only.** See Section 2.

**Microsoft's design intent:** minimal, concise, actionable. Only what is relevant to every
interaction. Link to detailed docs rather than embedding them.

**Core principles (from Microsoft reference docs):**
1. Minimal by default \u2014 only what matters for *every* task
2. Concise and actionable \u2014 every line should guide behavior
3. Link, don't embed \u2014 reference docs instead of copying content
4. Keep current \u2014 update when practices change

### 1.2 Custom Agents (`.agent.md`)

An `.agent.md` file defines a named agent available in the VS Code agent picker (`@name`).
It is loaded **only** when that agent is explicitly invoked in a chat session.

Key frontmatter fields:
```yaml
description: "..."          # Discovery surface \u2014 how parent agents find this agent
tools: [...]                # Tool allowlist \u2014 enforced by VS Code at runtime
argument-hint: "..."        # Guidance shown to the user in the picker
handoffs: [...]             # Transitions to other agents
```

The `tools:` list is the primary enforcement mechanism. VS Code silently blocks any tool
call not in the list. This is how `@qa`'s read-only constraint is enforced \u2014 not by
text instruction, but by omitting mutation tools from the frontmatter.

---

## 2. This Project's Instruction File Architecture

This project uses **`AGENTS.md` as the single always-on instruction file**. This follows
Microsoft's "use only one" guidance and aligns with VS Code's loading order (`AGENTS.md`
takes precedence over `copilot-instructions.md`).

| File | Role | Content |
|------|------|---------|
| `AGENTS.md` (root) | **Always-on** \u2014 operational reference + coordination manifest | Tool priority matrix, TDD protocol, quality gates, architecture contract, three-agent model, sub-roles, hand-over formats |
| `.github/agents/co.agent.md` | **@co role** | Coordination startup, sub-roles, tool allowlist (GitHub + read-only) |
| `.github/agents/imp.agent.md` | **@imp role** | Implementation startup, scope lock, architecture contract, hand-over format |
| `.github/agents/qa.agent.md` | **@qa role** | Review startup, suppression audit, verification workflow, tool allowlist (read-only) |

> **Historical note:** `.github/copilot-instructions.md` was the original always-on file.
> Its content has been consolidated into `AGENTS.md`. The file no longer exists in the
> project.

### Why AGENTS.md over copilot-instructions.md?

`AGENTS.md` is the newer standard (VS Code 1.99, April 2025), designed for agentic
workflows. VS Code checks `AGENTS.md` before `copilot-instructions.md` in its loading
order. It is also the format referenced by the AI agent community. Having a single
always-on file eliminates drift risk and halves context token usage for the always-on
layer.

### What should NOT be in the always-on file

Per Microsoft's "minimal by default" principle, `AGENTS.md` must not contain:
- Detailed startup protocols for specific agent roles (belongs in `.agent.md`)
- Phase-specific workflow instructions (served dynamically by `get_work_context`)
- Duplicated content that lives in linked reference documents

---

## 3. The Three-Agent Model

### Agent Roles

| Agent | Invocation | Mission | File |
|-------|-----------|---------|------|
| `@co` | `@co <sub-role>: <task>` | Coordination authority \u2014 assess, prioritize, author issues | [co.agent.md][co-agent] |
| `@imp` | `@imp <sub-role>: <task>` | Implementation executor \u2014 code, tests, commits, phase transitions | [imp.agent.md][imp-agent] |
| `@qa` | `@qa <sub-role>: <task>` | QA authority \u2014 read-only review, test runs, verdicts | [qa.agent.md][qa-agent] |

### Sub-Roles

Each agent has sub-roles that bind to a phase of the workflow:

**`@co`:** `triager` (default), `backlog-reviewer`, `tracker`, `issue-author`

**`@imp`:** `researcher` (default), `planner`, `designer`, `implementer`, `validator`, `documenter`

**`@qa`:** `design-reviewer` (default), `plan-verifier`, `verifier`, `validation-reviewer`, `doc-reviewer`

### Tool Restrictions by Agent

Tool restrictions are enforced by VS Code at the frontmatter level, not by text instruction.

| Capability | `@co` | `@imp` | `@qa` |
|------------|-------|--------|-------|
| Read files, search | \u2705 | \u2705 | \u2705 |
| Run tests / quality gates | \u274c | \u2705 | \u2705 |
| Edit files (`safe_edit_file`) | \u274c | \u2705 (via MCP) | \u274c |
| Git operations | \u274c read-only | \u2705 (via MCP) | \u274c read-only |
| GitHub issue/label/milestone | \u2705 | \u2705 (via MCP) | \u274c read-only |
| Phase transitions | \u274c | \u2705 (via MCP) | \u274c |
| All `phase-gate-mcp/*` tools | \u274c (explicit allowlist) | \u2705 (wildcard) | \u274c (explicit allowlist) |

`@imp` uses `tools: ["phase-gate-mcp/*"]` \u2014 all MCP tools. `@co` and `@qa` use explicit
per-tool allowlists that exclude mutation operations.

### Two-Chat Model

Use separate VS Code chat sessions for each role. This prevents role contamination:

```
User \u2192 @co triager: assess incoming issue \u2192 Co\u2192Imp hand-over
User \u2192 @imp implementer: execute cycle X  \u2192 Imp\u2192QA hand-over
User \u2192 @qa verifier: review C_LOADER.5   \u2192 GO/NOGO verdict
```

Never mix roles in one session. Fresh context prevents authority confusion and scope drift.

---

## 4. Phase-Gate MCP Integration

### 4.1 `get_work_context` \u2014 the runtime context bridge

The `get_work_context` MCP tool is the bridge between the static instruction files and the
dynamic workflow state. It reads the active branch's `.phase-gate/state.json`, queries the
GitHub issue, and returns a context block that agents can act on immediately.

**Key fields returned:**

| Field | Type | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| `current_phase` | string | Active workflow phase |
| `current_branch` | string | Active git branch |
| `workflow_name` | string | Active workflow type (feature/bug/etc.) |
| `active_issue` | object | GitHub issue title, number, labels |
| `sub_role_hint` | string | Suggested `@imp` sub-role for the current phase |
| `phase_instructions` | string | **Operational TODO list for the current phase** |

### 4.2 `phase_instructions` \u2014 dynamic operational script

`phase_instructions` is a multi-line string that contains the complete TODO list for the
current (workflow, phase) combination. It is generated by `GetWorkContextTool` from a
lookup table (`_PHASE_INSTRUCTIONS_MAP`) keyed on `(workflow_name, phase_name)`.

**Example output for `(bug, implementation)` phase:**

```
Create a TODO list now and work through it step by step:

[ ] Call get_project_plan to load TDD cycle deliverables
[ ] Identify the active TDD cycle from the planning document
[ ] Write the failing test (RED sub-phase) ...
[ ] Commit with sub_phase="red", cycle_number=N
...
[ ] Produce the Imp\u2192QA hand-over block
```

**Why this matters:** `@imp` agents can autonomously execute all phases because
`transition_phase` has no built-in human-approval gate. `phase_instructions` is the
mechanism that scopes the agent to the current phase's expected behavior. It is returned
at invocation time, not embedded in a static file, so it can evolve without changing the
`.agent.md` file.

### 4.3 `sub_role_hint` \u2014 sub-role guidance

`sub_role_hint` maps the current phase to the correct `@imp` sub-role:

| Phase | Sub-role hint |
|-------|--------------|
| research | researcher |
| design | designer |
| planning | planner |
| implementation | implementer |
| validation | validator |
| documentation | documenter |
| ready | documenter |

This ensures the agent declares the correct sub-role without guessing from the phase name.

### 4.4 How `@imp` uses these fields

The `imp.agent.md` precedence chain is:

```
1. Runtime-injected system instructions
2. phase_instructions from get_work_context  \u2190 overrides 3\u20135 when present
3. AGENTS.md
4. imp.agent.md (this file)
5. Latest user request
```

`phase_instructions` sits at precedence #2. When present, it is the authoritative
operational script for the session. The agent reads all lower-priority documents only
when `phase_instructions` is absent or explicitly directs it to do so.

---

## 5. Context Loading Order Per Session Type

### Default Copilot chat (no `@agent` invoked)

```
Always loaded:
  AGENTS.md                      \u2190 operational reference + coordination manifest
```

### `@co` session

```
Always loaded:
  AGENTS.md

On @co invocation:
  .github/agents/co.agent.md     \u2190 role persona, tool allowlist, sub-roles

Startup sequence (per co.agent.md):
  1. get_work_context
  2. list_issues(state="open")
  3. [tracker only] get_issue(<number>)
```

### `@imp` session

```
Always loaded:
  AGENTS.md

On @imp invocation:
  .github/agents/imp.agent.md    \u2190 role persona, full MCP tool access

Startup sequence (per imp.agent.md):
  1. get_work_context
     \u2514\u2500 if phase_instructions present \u2192 follow it as operational script
     \u2514\u2500 if absent \u2192 read AGENTS.md, then proceed
  2. ARCHITECTURE_PRINCIPLES.md  \u2190 always binding
  3. [conditional] get_project_plan
  4. Inspect worktree for existing changes
  5. Inspect latest QA verdict
```

### `@qa` session

```
Always loaded:
  AGENTS.md

On @qa invocation:
  .github/agents/qa.agent.md     \u2190 role persona, read-only tool allowlist

Startup sequence (per qa.agent.md):
  1. AGENTS.md                        \u2190 always read first
  2. ARCHITECTURE_PRINCIPLES.md
  3. get_work_context
  4. get_project_plan for active issue
  5. Read active planning document
  6. Read changed files in worktree
  7. Read latest implementation hand-over
```

## 7. Design Decisions and Rationale

### Why AGENTS.md as the single always-on file?

`AGENTS.md` is newer than `copilot-instructions.md` and was designed specifically for
agentic VS Code workflows (introduced VS Code 1.99, April 2025). VS Code checks `AGENTS.md`
before `copilot-instructions.md` in its loading order, making it the natural primary.

Using a single always-on file:
- Eliminates the drift risk between two files that must stay synchronized
- Halves the context token cost for the always-on instruction layer
- Follows Microsoft's "use only one" guidance
- Makes the project's instruction architecture visible and understandable to a developer
  reading the repo root

The content previously in `copilot-instructions.md` (tool priority matrix, TDD protocol,
quality gates, architecture contract) has been merged into `AGENTS.md`. That file no
longer exists in the project.

### Why `phase_instructions` via MCP and not in the `.agent.md` file?

Three reasons:
1. **Dynamic**: phase instructions change as the project evolves without requiring agent
   file changes. The lookup table in `GetWorkContextTool` is the single source of truth.
2. **Per-workflow**: different workflows (feature/bug/docs/refactor) have different phase
   instructions for the same phase name. A static file cannot express this without complex
   conditionals.
3. **Precedence position**: by returning `phase_instructions` at runtime, `@imp` can place
   it at precedence #2 (above all static files), making it the highest-authority script.
   This is not achievable with static embedded text.

### Why is `@qa` read-only enforced at the tool level, not by text?

Text instructions can be overridden by an autonomous agent under task pressure.
Tool restrictions in `tools:` frontmatter are enforced by VS Code before the model runs.
An `@qa` session physically cannot call `safe_edit_file` or `git_add_or_commit` because
those tools are not in its allowlist. This is hard enforcement, not soft guidance.

### Why does `@imp` use `tools: ["phase-gate-mcp/*"]` (wildcard)?

`@imp` is the implementation executor. It needs the full MCP surface. Maintaining an
explicit per-tool allowlist would require updating the agent file every time a new MCP
tool is added. The wildcard future-proofs the agent. The `@imp` role boundary is enforced
by the `.agent.md` body instructions and by QA review \u2014 not by tool restriction.

---

## 8. Adding a New Workflow Phase

If a new workflow is added to `workflows.yaml` and a new phase is added, the instruction
layer must be updated:

1. Add entries to `_PHASE_INSTRUCTIONS_MAP` in `mcp_server/tools/discovery_tools.py`
   for every `(workflow_name, phase_name)` tuple that should have instructions.
2. Add an entry to `_SUB_ROLE_MAP` if the phase needs a specific `@imp` sub-role hint.
3. Test with `get_work_context` on a branch in that workflow+phase to verify the output.

No changes to `.agent.md` files or `AGENTS.md` are required for new phases \u2014 those files
are static infrastructure.
