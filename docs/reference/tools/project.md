# Project & Phase Management Tools

**Status:** DEFINITIVE  
**Version:** 3.2  
**Last Updated:** 2026-09-13  

**Source:** [mcp_server/tools/project_tools.py](../../../mcp_server/tools/project_tools.py), [phase_tools.py](../../../mcp_server/tools/phase_tools.py)  
**Tests:** [tests/mcp_server/unit/tools/test_project_tools.py](../../../tests/mcp_server/unit/tools/test_project_tools.py), [tests/mcp_server/unit/tools/test_transition_phase_tool.py](../../../tests/mcp_server/unit/tools/test_transition_phase_tool.py), [tests/mcp_server/unit/tools/test_force_phase_transition_tool.py](../../../tests/mcp_server/unit/tools/test_force_phase_transition_tool.py)  

---

## Purpose

Complete reference documentation for project lifecycle and phase management tools. These 4 tools provide workflow initialization, phase plan inspection, sequential phase transitions, and emergency phase skipping with human approval.

Phase state persists in [.pgmcp/state.json](../../../.pgmcp/state.json) and workflow definitions / planning deliverables persist in [.pgmcp/deliverables.json](../../../.pgmcp/deliverables.json). Both files are branch-local artifacts synchronized with git branch operations and neutralized before PR submission.

---

## Overview

The MCP server provides **4 project/phase tools**:

| Tool | Purpose | Key Feature |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `initialize_project` | Initialize project with workflow selection | Human selects workflow type |
| `get_project_plan` | Inspect project phase plan | Read-only phase inspection |
| `transition_phase` | Sequential phase transition | Strict validation |
| `force_phase_transition` | Skip phases (emergency) | Requires reason + human approval |

All tools interact with:
- **PhaseStateEngine:** Phase state tracking and validation
- **[.pgmcp/config/workflows.yaml](../../../.pgmcp/config/workflows.yaml):** Workflow definitions (feature, bug, docs, refactor, hotfix, chore, epic)
- **[.pgmcp/state.json](../../../.pgmcp/state.json):** Current branch state (branch-local artifact, committed with branch history; neutralized by `submit_pr`)
- **[.pgmcp/deliverables.json](../../../.pgmcp/deliverables.json):** Workflow definition and planning deliverables (branch-local artifact)

---

## API Reference

### initialize_project

**MCP Name:** `initialize_project`  
**Class:** `InitializeProjectTool`  
**File:** [mcp_server/tools/project_tools.py](../../../mcp_server/tools/project_tools.py)

Initialize project with phase plan selection. The configured `workflow_name` selects the project-specific phase plan.

#### Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `issue_number` | `int` | **Yes** | GitHub issue number |
| `issue_title` | `str` | **Yes** | Issue title |
| `workflow_name` | `str` | **Yes** | Workflow name. Valid values are populated at runtime from `contracts.yaml` via enum injection (C3 A4 override). Examples: `"feature"`, `"bug"`, `"docs"`, `"refactor"`, `"hotfix"`, `"chore"`, `"epic"`. |
| `parent_branch` | `str` | No | Parent branch this feature/bug branches from (auto-detected from git reflog if not provided) |
| `custom_phases` | `list[str]` | No | Optional required-phase override stored in the selected configured project plan. It does not register a workflow or change strict contract transition order. |
| `skip_reason` | `str` | **Conditional** | Required audit justification when `custom_phases` is provided |

#### Workflow Types

| Workflow | Phases | Use Case |
|----------|--------|----------|
| `feature` | research → design → planning → implementation → validation → documentation → ready | New feature development |
| `bug` | research → design → planning → implementation → validation → documentation → ready | Bug fixes |
| `docs` | planning → documentation → ready | Documentation-only changes |
| `refactor` | research → design → planning → implementation → validation → documentation → ready | Code refactoring |
| `hotfix` | implementation → validation → documentation → ready | Emergency fixes |
| `chore` | research → implementation → validation → documentation → ready | Lightweight maintenance and housekeeping |
| `epic` | See `contracts.yaml` for the configured phase order | Multi-issue coordination |

#### Returns (via MCP Resource Cache)

`initialize_project` presents the realized issue, workflow, branch, initial phase, parent,
execution mode, and bounded `required_phases` and `files_created` collections. The
complete `InitializeProjectOutput` remains available through the resource link.

The DTO is stored in the MCP Resource cache at `pgmcp://cache/runs/{run_id}` and contains the following fields:
- `success`: `bool`
- `error_message`: `string | null`
- `post_tool_instruction`: `string | null`
- `issue_number`: `int`
- `workflow_name`: `string`
- `branch`: `string`
- `initial_phase`: `string`
- `parent_branch`: `string | null`
- `required_phases`: `list[string]`
- `execution_mode`: `string`
- `files_created`: `list[string]`

#### Example Usage

**Feature workflow:**
```json
{
  "issue_number": 123,
  "issue_title": "Add OAuth2 authentication",
  "workflow_name": "feature",
  "parent_branch": "main"
}
```

#### Behavior Notes

- **State Persistence:** Creates `.pgmcp/deliverables.json` (workflow definition) and `.pgmcp/state.json` (branch state) atomically
- **Parent Branch Auto-Detection:** If `parent_branch` not provided, attempts detection via `git reflog`
- **Branch Validation:** Current branch must match pattern `<type>/<issue_number>-*`
- **Idempotency:** Re-running on same branch returns error (project already initialized)
- **Configured workflow required:** `custom_phases` does not create an arbitrary workflow; `workflow_name` must exist in `contracts.yaml`, and strict transitions use that configured contract

#### Workflow Responsibility

`initialize_project` **must be called by `@co` (coordination role)** as part of the start-issue lifecycle, always after `create_branch` and `git_checkout`.

`@imp` (implementation role) always inherits a branch where `initialize_project` has already completed. If `@imp` reaches a branch without `.pgmcp/state.json`, this is a process violation — `@imp` must **not** call `initialize_project` as recovery; it must stop and report the blocker so `@co` can correct the lifecycle.

### get_project_plan

**MCP Name:** `get_project_plan`  
**Class:** `GetProjectPlanTool`  
**File:** [mcp_server/tools/project_tools.py](../../../mcp_server/tools/project_tools.py)

Get project phases and complete stored planning deliverables for an issue.

#### Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `issue_number` | `int` | **Yes** | GitHub issue number |

#### Returns (via MCP Resource Cache)

`get_project_plan` presents the issue and workflow followed by bounded phase records.
Each phase shows its name and status; configured child collections show task ID, title,
and status. Phase and task order is preserved from the DTO.

The DTO is stored in the MCP Resource cache at `pgmcp://cache/runs/{run_id}` and contains the following fields:
- `success`: `bool`
- `error_message`: `string | null`
- `post_tool_instruction`: `string | null`
- `issue_number`: `int`
- `workflow_name`: `string`
- `phases`: `list[PhaseDTO]`, where each phase contains:
  - `name`: `string`
  - `status`: `string`
  - `tasks`: `list[PhaseTaskDTO]` with `id`, `title`, and `status`
- `planning_deliverables`: optional existing `CyclePlanningModel`, containing every stored cycle number/name, ordered deliverable ID/description/validates and exit criterion, plus design/validation/documentation deliverables. It is absent from the compact cache JSON when planning has not yet been saved. Invalid stored planning returns a failed result; it is never silently omitted from a successful partial plan.

#### Reading large cached plans

The normal text presentation retains a short cache URI. Only complete cached results
larger than the configured read budget also link to `pgmcp://docs/cache-reading`.
That MCP resource serves the packaged [cache-reading reference](../../../mcp_server/resources/cache_reading.md),
including the unchanged window, integrity, truncation, and safe retry protocol.
It is available without a repository checkout. For an expired cached plan, repeat
the read-only `get_project_plan` query and use its new run URI.

#### Example Usage

```json
{
  "issue_number": 123
}
```

#### Behavior Notes

- **Planning Read:** Does not rewrite or back up the deliverables source during queries, including invalid-envelope failures. Current-phase enrichment retains the existing workflow-state resolver behavior.
- **Plan Access:** Reads the configured project plan and returns phases plus the complete stored planning payload; existing phase/task presentation remains unchanged.
- **Not Found:** Returns error if project not initialized

---

### transition_phase

**MCP Name:** `transition_phase`  
**Class:** `TransitionPhaseTool`  
**File:** [mcp_server/tools/phase_tools.py](../../../mcp_server/tools/phase_tools.py)

Transition branch to next phase (strict sequential validation).

#### Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `branch` | `str` | **Yes** | Branch name (e.g., `"feature/123-oauth"`) |
| `to_phase` | `str` | **Yes** | Target phase to transition to. Run `get_work_context()` to see valid phases for the current branch; enum is injected at runtime from `workphases.yaml`. |
| `human_approval_message` | `str` | No | Optional human approval message (audit trail) |

#### Returns

The bounded text confirms `from_phase`, `to_phase`, `branch`, and passing/skipped gate
counts. When gates were skipped, up to 20 skipped-gate identifiers are listed inline;
the complete `passing_gates` and `skipped_gates` sequences remain in the cached
`PhaseTransitionOutput` DTO.

#### Example Usage

**Sequential transition:**
```json
{
  "branch": "feature/123-oauth",
  "to_phase": "green"
}
```

**With human approval:**
```json
{
  "branch": "feature/123-oauth",
  "to_phase": "documentation",
  "human_approval_message": "Tests passing, code reviewed, ready for docs"
}
```

#### Behavior Notes

- **Sequential Validation:** Target phase must be the **next** phase in workflow (no skipping)
- **State Update:** Updates `.pgmcp/state.json` atomically
- **Branch-Local State:** Updates `.pgmcp/state.json` for the active branch only
- **Required Next Step:** On success, the response appends `🚀 REQUIRED NEXT STEP: Call get_work_context now before any other tool call to load the current phase context for this branch.`
- **Not Initialized:** Returns error if project not initialized

#### Example Error (Attempting to Skip)

**Request:**
```json
{
  "branch": "feature/123-oauth",
  "to_phase": "merge-prep"  // Trying to skip from "red" to "merge-prep"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Invalid phase transition: cannot skip from 'red' to 'merge-prep'. Next phase is 'green'. Use force_phase_transition if intentional."
}
```

---

### force_phase_transition

**MCP Name:** `force_phase_transition`  
**Class:** `ForcePhaseTransitionTool`  
**File:** [mcp_server/tools/phase_tools.py](../../../mcp_server/tools/phase_tools.py)

Force non-sequential phase transition (skip/jump with reason and human approval).

#### Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `branch` | `str` | **Yes** | Branch name (e.g., `"feature/123-oauth"`) |
| `to_phase` | `str` | **Yes** | Target phase to transition to (can skip phases). Run `get_work_context()` to see valid phases for the current branch; enum is injected at runtime from `workphases.yaml`. |
| `skip_reason` | `str` | **Yes** | Reason for skipping validation (audit trail) — must be non-empty (min_length=1) |
| `human_approval_message` | `str` | **Yes** | Human approval message (REQUIRED for forced transitions) — must be non-empty (min_length=1) |

#### Returns

The bounded text contains the normal transition fields and gate evidence plus
`skip_reason` and `human_approval_message`. The complete structured
`ForcePhaseTransitionOutput` is stored in the resource cache.

#### Example Usage

```json
{
  "branch": "feature/123-oauth",
  "to_phase": "merge-prep",
  "skip_reason": "Emergency hotfix: critical security vulnerability discovered",
  "human_approval_message": "Approved by Tech Lead (John Doe) - immediate merge required"
}
```

#### Behavior Notes

- **No Validation:** Bypasses sequential phase validation
- **Branch-Local State:** Updates `.pgmcp/state.json` for the active branch; forced-transition metadata stays in that branch-local state
- **Required Next Step:** On success, the response appends `🚀 REQUIRED NEXT STEP: Call get_work_context now before any other tool call to load the current phase context for this branch.`
- **Use Sparingly:** Intended for emergency situations only
- **Required Fields:** Both `skip_reason` and `human_approval_message` are REQUIRED (not optional)

---

### transition_cycle and force_cycle_transition

`transition_cycle(to_cycle, issue_number?)` advances sequentially to the next planned
implementation cycle. `force_cycle_transition(to_cycle, skip_reason,
human_approval_message, issue_number?)` permits a skip or backward transition with an
explicit audit trail.

Both responses present the source and target cycle, total cycle count, cycle name,
branch, and passing/skipped gate counts. Up to 20 skipped-gate identifiers are rendered
when present. The force response additionally shows the reason and approval. Complete
gate sequences remain in the cached `CycleTransitionOutput` or
`ForceCycleTransitionOutput` DTO. A successful transition instructs the caller to reload
`get_work_context` before another governed operation.

## State Management

### save_planning_deliverables

**MCP Name:** `save_planning_deliverables`  
**Class:** `SavePlanningDeliverablesTool`  
**File:** [mcp_server/tools/project_tools.py](../../../mcp_server/tools/project_tools.py)

Save cycle planning deliverables for an issue to deliverables.json. Validates each `validates` entry schema before persisting.

#### Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `issue_number` | `int` | **Yes** | GitHub issue number |
| `planning_deliverables` | `dict` | **Yes** | Planning deliverables dict with `cycles.total` + `cycles[]`. Each deliverable entry may include a `validates` spec with `type` + required fields (Layer 2 runtime validation). |

#### Returns (via MCP Resource Cache)

`save_planning_deliverables` presents the issue, total cycles, total deliverables, and a
bounded per-cycle deliverable count. The complete structured result remains cached.

The DTO is stored in the MCP Resource cache at `pgmcp://cache/runs/{run_id}` and contains:
- `success`: `bool`
- `error_message`: `string | null`
- `post_tool_instruction`: `string | null`
- `issue_number`: `int`
- `total_cycles`: `int`
- `total_deliverables`: `int`
- `cycles`: `list[PlannedCycleSummary]` with `cycle_number` and `deliverables_count`

#### Behavior Notes

- **Write-Once:** Raises an error if deliverables already exist for the issue (use `update_planning_deliverables` to extend)
- **Layer 2 Validation:** Every `validates` entry is validated before writing

---

### update_planning_deliverables

**MCP Name:** `update_planning_deliverables`  
**Class:** `UpdatePlanningDeliverablesTool`  
**File:** [mcp_server/tools/project_tools.py](../../../mcp_server/tools/project_tools.py)

Merge-update cycle planning deliverables for an issue in deliverables.json. Must be preceded by `save_planning_deliverables`. New cycles are appended; deliverables within existing cycles are merged by id.

#### Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `issue_number` | `int` | **Yes** | GitHub issue number |
| `planning_deliverables` | `dict` | **Yes** | Partial or full planning deliverables to merge. New cycles are appended; existing cycles have deliverables merged by id. Deliverable entries may include a `validates` spec with `type` + required fields (Layer 2 validation). |

#### Returns (via MCP Resource Cache)

`update_planning_deliverables` uses the same bounded presentation and cached
`PlanningDeliverablesOutput` contract as `save_planning_deliverables`.

The DTO is stored in the MCP Resource cache at `pgmcp://cache/runs/{run_id}` and contains:
- `success`: `bool`
- `error_message`: `string | null`
- `post_tool_instruction`: `string | null`
- `issue_number`: `int`
- `total_cycles`: `int`
- `total_deliverables`: `int`
- `cycles`: `list[PlannedCycleSummary]` with `cycle_number` and `deliverables_count`

#### Behavior Notes

- **Requires Prior Save:** Returns error if `save_planning_deliverables` was not called first (write-once guard)
- **Merge Strategy:** New cycle → append; existing cycle + new id → append; existing id → overwrite
- **Layer 2 Validation:** Every `validates` entry is validated before writing

### .pgmcp/state.json

Current branch state (runtime, branch-local, neutralized before PR submission):

```json
{
  "schema_version": "1.0.0",
  "branch": "feature/123-oauth",
  "issue_number": 123,
  "workflow_name": "feature",
  "current_phase": "documentation",
  "current_cycle": null,
  "last_cycle": 3,
  "cycle_history": [],
  "required_phases": [
    "research",
    "design",
    "planning",
    "implementation",
    "validation",
    "documentation"
  ],
  "execution_mode": "normal",
  "skip_reason": null,
  "issue_title": "Add OAuth2 authentication",
  "parent_branch": "main",
  "created_at": "2026-02-08T10:00:00Z",
  "transitions": []
}
```

**Behavior:**
- Validated at load-time by `StateVersionValidator` against expected SemVer `1.0.0`.
- Updated by `initialize_project`, `transition_phase`, and `force_phase_transition`.
- On schema version mismatch or file corruption, `StateVersionValidator` performs a Clean Break: backs up the file to `state.json.bak` and raises a `ConfigError` without fallback git-log reconstruction.
- Synchronized by `git_checkout` (loads state when switching branches).
- Treated as a branch-local artifact and neutralized before `submit_pr`.
---

### .pgmcp/deliverables.json

Workflow definition and planning deliverables (branch-local artifact):

```json
{
  "schema_version": "1.0.0",
  "projects": {
    "123": {
      "issue_title": "Add OAuth2 authentication",
      "workflow_name": "feature",
      "execution_mode": "normal",
      "required_phases": [
        "research",
        "design",
        "planning",
        "implementation",
        "validation",
        "documentation"
      ],
      "skip_reason": null,
      "parent_branch": "main",
      "created_at": "2026-02-08T10:00:00Z",
      "planning_deliverables": {
        "cycles": {
          "total": 3,
          "cycles": []
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Behavior:**
- Wrapped in a top-level `"schema_version": "1.0.0"` envelope and validated by `StateVersionValidator` on load.
- Initialized by `initialize_project`.
- Extended by `save_planning_deliverables` and `update_planning_deliverables`.
- On schema version mismatch or corruption, `StateVersionValidator` backs up to `deliverables.json.bak` and raises `ConfigError`.
- Treated as a branch-local artifact and neutralized before `submit_pr`.

## Workflow Definitions

### .pgmcp/config/workflows.yaml

> **Note (Issue #271):** Phase membership and ordering are no longer defined in `workflows.yaml`. The file now contains only workflow metadata (name, description, execution mode). Phase sequences are exclusively defined in `.pgmcp/config/contracts.yaml`.

```yaml
# .pgmcp/config/workflows.yaml
version: "1.0"
phase_source: ".pgmcp/config/workphases.yaml"

workflows:
  feature:
    name: feature
    description: "Full development workflow (research → design → planning → implementation → validation → docs)"
    default_execution_mode: interactive

  bug:
    name: bug
    description: "Bug fix workflow (research → design → planning → implementation → validation → docs)"
    default_execution_mode: interactive

  hotfix:
    name: hotfix
    description: "Emergency fix workflow (implementation → validation → docs only)"
    default_execution_mode: autonomous

  refactor:
    name: refactor
    description: "Code refactoring workflow (research → design → planning → implementation → validation → docs)"
    default_execution_mode: interactive

  docs:
    name: docs
    description: "Documentation-only workflow (planning → docs)"
    default_execution_mode: interactive

  chore:
    name: chore
    description: "Lightweight maintenance workflow"
    default_execution_mode: interactive

  epic:
    name: epic
    description: "Epic workflow for large initiatives (research → planning → design → coordination → documentation)"
    default_execution_mode: interactive

```


For the phase sequences per workflow, see `.pgmcp/config/contracts.yaml`. For the complete extension procedure, see [Adding a First-Class Workflow](../workflow-extension-guide.md).

## Integration with Git Tools

Phase state is **synchronized** with git branch operations:

| Git Operation | Phase State Behavior |
|---------------|---------------------|
| `git_checkout` | Loads phase state from `.pgmcp/state.json` after switching branches |
| `create_branch` | No phase state (must run `initialize_project` after) |
| `git_delete_branch` | Removes phase state from `.pgmcp/state.json` |

---

## Common Workflows

### Starting a New Feature

```
1. create_branch(name="feature/123-oauth", base_branch="main")
2. git_checkout(branch="feature/123-oauth")
3. initialize_project(issue_number=123, issue_title="Add OAuth2", workflow_name="feature")
```

### TDD Cycle with Phase Transitions

```
1. transition_phase(branch="feature/123-oauth", to_phase="red")
2. scaffold_artifact(artifact_type="dto", name="OAuthToken")
3. git_add_or_commit(workflow_phase="implementation", sub_phase="red", cycle_number=1, message="Add failing test for OAuthToken")
4. transition_phase(branch="feature/123-oauth", to_phase="green")
5. safe_edit_file(...)  # Implement
6. run_tests(path="tests/test_oauth.py")
7. git_add_or_commit(workflow_phase="implementation", sub_phase="green", cycle_number=1, message="Implement OAuthToken")
```

### Emergency Phase Skip (Hotfix)

```
1. force_phase_transition(
     branch="bug/456-security",
     to_phase="merge-prep",
     skip_reason="Critical security vulnerability - zero-day exploit",
     human_approval_message="CTO approval (Jane Smith) - immediate production deployment"
   )
2. git_push(set_upstream=True)
3. submit_pr(title="HOTFIX: Security patch", body="...", head="bug/456-security")
4. merge_pr(pr_number=78, merge_method="merge")
```
