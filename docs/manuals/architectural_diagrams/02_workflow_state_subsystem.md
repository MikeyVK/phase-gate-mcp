# Workflow State Subsystem

**Status:** DRAFT
**Version:** 1.0
**Last Updated:** 2026-03-13

---

## Purpose

Show the four core components of the workflow-state subsystem, their relationships, and the
integration gap between the built components and their actual wiring.

## Scope

**In Scope:** PhaseStateEngine, StateRepository, PhaseContractResolver, DeliverableChecker and
their mutual relationships

**Out of Scope:** Tool layer on top of PSE (see 03), config layer (see 05)

---

## 1. Component Relationships

Four components form the workflow-state subsystem. Solid arrows represent active, wired
relationships. The dashed arrows mark the integration gap (RC-2): `PhaseContractResolver` and
`DeliverableChecker` were built as proper SRP components but are not yet connected to
`PhaseStateEngine` via dependency injection. Orange nodes indicate components affected by the gap.

    SR["StateRepository<br/>(load / save state.json)"]
    PCR["PhaseContractResolver<br/>(config → CheckSpec list)"]
    DC["DeliverableChecker<br/>(runs CheckSpecs)"]

    PSE -->|"direct new (3×)"| DC

## 2. PhaseStateEngine Internals (God Class)

`PhaseStateEngine` currently holds five distinct responsibilities in a single class. This
diagram shows what it does and which responsibilities should be extracted.

```mermaid
graph TD
    PSE["PhaseStateEngine"]

    PSE --> T["Transition validation<br/>(6× if from_phase == ...)"]
    PSE --> C["Cycle counter management"]
    PSE --> EX["on_exit_* hooks<br/>(5 duplicated methods)"]
    PSE --> DC2["DeliverableChecker<br/>instantiation (3×)"]
    PSE --> SR2["StateRepository calls"]

    style T  fill:#fdd,color:#000
    style EX fill:#fdd,color:#000
    style DC2 fill:#fdd,color:#000
```

Red nodes indicate code that violates OCP, DRY, or DIP and should be refactored.

## Constraints & Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Alternatives Rejected |
|----------|-----------|----------------------|
| StateRepository encapsulates all state I/O | Single place for `.phase-gate/state.json` read/write; tools and managers must not bypass it | Direct JSON file access from tools |
| PCR and DeliverableChecker as SRP components | Each has one reason to change; enables independent testing | Inlining both into PSE (already the current debt) |

---

## Known Architectural Issues

| ID | Component | Issue | Severity |
|----|-----------|-------|----------|
| RC-2 | PCR | Built and tested but not wired into PSE exit-hooks | High |
| RC-2 | DeliverableChecker | Instantiated directly 3× inside PSE instead of injected | High |
| A-02 | StateRepository | `cycle_tools.py` calls `state_engine._save_state()` — private method called from outside | Medium |
| Gap-3 | PSE | 6× `if from_phase ==` chains — OCP violation | Medium |
| Gap-4 | PSE | 5× duplicated `on_exit_*_phase` methods — DRY violation | Medium |
| Gap-5 | PSE | `logger.info(f"...")` throughout — f-string logging anti-pattern | Low |
