# Runtime Flows

**Status:** DRAFT
**Version:** 1.0
**Last Updated:** 2026-03-13

---

## Purpose

Show three critical runtime flows as sequence diagrams: `initialize_branch`,
`transition_phase`, and `git_add_or_commit`.

## Scope

**In Scope:** Three runtime flows at sequence level

**Out of Scope:** All other flows, detailed error paths

---

## 1. Flow: `initialize_branch`

`InitializeProjectTool` sets up the initial branch state in `.phase-gate/state.json`. The
`EnforcementRunner` pre-hook runs `check_branch_policy` before the tool executes.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client as VS Code
    participant Tool   as InitializeProjectTool
    participant ER     as EnforcementRunner
    participant PM     as ProjectManager
    participant SR     as StateRepository

    Client->>ER: initialize_project(branch, workflow)
    ER->>ER: pre-hook check_branch_policy
    ER->>Tool: execute()
    Tool->>PM: setup_project(branch, workflow)
    PM->>SR: save_state(branch, initial_state)
    SR-->>PM: ok
    PM-->>Tool: ProjectPlan
    Tool-->>ER: ToolResult
    ER-->>Client: success
```

---

## 2. Flow: `transition_phase`

`TransitionPhaseTool` delegates to `PhaseStateEngine`. The PSE runs `on_exit_*` hooks
(which currently instantiate `DeliverableChecker` directly). After the tool completes,
the `EnforcementRunner` post-hook auto-commits `.phase-gate/state.json`.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client as VS Code
    participant Tool   as TransitionPhaseTool
    participant PSE    as PhaseStateEngine
    participant DC     as DeliverableChecker (new)
    participant SR     as StateRepository
    participant ER     as EnforcementRunner

    Client->>Tool: transition_phase(branch, to_phase)
    Tool->>PSE: transition(branch, to_phase)
    PSE->>SR: load_state(branch)
    SR-->>PSE: BranchState
    PSE->>PSE: validate_transition (6× if-chain)
    PSE->>DC: new DeliverableChecker(workspace_root)
    DC-->>PSE: checks passed
    PSE->>SR: save_state(branch, new_state)
    PSE-->>Tool: TransitionResult
    Tool-->>ER: ToolResult
    ER->>ER: post-hook commit_state_files
    ER-->>Client: success
```

The `new DeliverableChecker(...)` call in the middle is the DIP violation (RC-2).

---

## 3. Flow: `git_add_or_commit`

`GitCommitTool` resolves the commit type via `PhaseContractResolver` (the only productive
use of PCR today), then delegates to `GitManager`. Note the third PSE instantiation route.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client as VS Code
    participant Tool   as GitCommitTool
    participant PCR    as PhaseContractResolver
    participant PSE    as PhaseStateEngine (new)
    participant GM     as GitManager

    Client->>Tool: git_add_or_commit(message, phase, sub_phase)
    Tool->>PSE: new PhaseStateEngine(workspace_root)
    Tool->>PCR: resolve_commit_type(phase, sub_phase)
    PCR-->>Tool: commit_type (e.g. "test")
    Tool->>GM: commit_with_scope(files, message, commit_type)
    GM-->>Tool: commit_hash
    Tool-->>Client: success
```

The `new PhaseStateEngine(...)` on line 2 is the third instantiation route (see 04).

## Constraints & Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Alternatives Rejected |
|----------|-----------|----------------------|
| EnforcementRunner wraps tool execute | Tools are unaware of pre/post logic | Each tool calls enforcement manually |
| PCR for commit-type resolution | Only productive integration of PCR in the current codebase | Hardcoded commit-type map in GitCommitTool |

---

## Known Architectural Issues

| ID | Component | Issue | Severity |
|----|-----------|-------|----------|
| RC-2 | `transition_phase` flow | `DeliverableChecker` instantiated directly inside PSE instead of injected | High |
| RC-7 | `git_add_or_commit` flow | Third `PhaseStateEngine` instantiation route in `GitCommitTool` | Medium |
