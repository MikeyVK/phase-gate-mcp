# System Context

**Status:** DRAFT
**Version:** 1.0
**Last Updated:** 2026-03-13

## Purpose

Show the MCP Server as a black box within its environment: which external actors communicate
with it and through which channels. Two runtime variants exist — production and local development.

## Scope

**In Scope:** External actors, communication channels, runtime context (production vs. development)

**Out of Scope:** Internal component structure (see 01_module_decomposition.md and further)

---

## 1. Production Context

In production, VS Code communicates directly with the MCP Server over stdio. The server reads
and writes to the filesystem (`.phase-gate/` state files and workspace files) and calls GitHub via
the `gh` CLI. There is no HTTP layer — stdio is the only entry point into the server.

    Server["MCP Server<br/>(FastMCP)"]
    Git["Git / GitHub"]
    FS["Filesystem<br/>(.phase-gate/ + workspace)"]

    VSCode -->|"stdio"| Server
    Server -->|"read/write"| FS
    Server -->|"gh CLI"| Git
```

## 2. Development Context (with Proxy)

During local development a transparent restart proxy (`MCPProxy`) sits between VS Code and the
server. VS Code maintains a stable stdio connection to the proxy; the proxy can restart the MCP
Server process without requiring VS Code to reconnect. The yellow node marks the dev-only
component — see `07_dev_infrastructure.md` for the restart flow.

```mermaid
graph TD
    VSCode["VS Code<br/>(MCP Client)"]
    Proxy["MCP Proxy<br/>(dev only)"]
    Server["MCP Server<br/>(FastMCP)"]
    Git["Git / GitHub"]
    FS["Filesystem<br/>(.phase-gate/ + workspace)"]

    VSCode -->|"stdio (stable)"| Proxy
    Proxy -->|"stdio (restartable)"| Server
    Server -->|"read/write"| FS
    Server -->|"gh CLI"| Git

    style Proxy fill:#f0e68c,color:#000
```

All tool calls pass through the proxy transparently. The only observable effect is a ~2.3 s
restart latency when `restart_server` is invoked.

## Constraints & Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Alternatives Rejected |
|----------|-----------|----------------------|
| stdio as transport | MCP standard; no network configuration required | HTTP/SSE transport (more overhead, unnecessary for local use) |
| Proxy in dev only | Hot-restart without VS Code reconnect; production has availability risk via `restart_server` | Proxy always active (increases attack surface) |
