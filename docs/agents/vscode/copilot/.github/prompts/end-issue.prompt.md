# End Issue

Complete explicit lifecycle exit. Human invocation of this prompt is the required
merge-approval signal. Do not invoke this prompt autonomously or as part of an
automated pipeline.

## Required Input

- `PR_NUMBER` — required. Stop and ask if missing; do not guess.
- `ISSUE_NUMBER` — optional. Supply only when recovery requires an explicit issue target.
  When absent, derive from the PR body at the point a recovery step needs it.

## Working State

Assign these named values as you execute the sequence. Use these names throughout;
do not reference steps by number when referring to previously captured data.

| Name | Set in | Value |
|---|---|---|
| `HEAD_BRANCH` | step 1 | `head_branch` from first `get_pr` |
| `BASE_BRANCH` | step 1 | `base_branch` from first `get_pr` |
| `MERGE_SHA` | step 3 | `merge_sha` from second `get_pr` |
| `PR_BODY` | step 3 | `body` from second `get_pr` |
| `PARENT_WORKFLOW` | step 7 | `workflow` from `get_work_context`, or `""` when absent |
| `PARENT_ISSUE` | step 7 | `issue_number` from `get_work_context`, or `""` when absent |

## Common Sequence

Execute in this exact order. Do not skip steps. Stop at the first blocker and report it.

1. **Load PR metadata**
   `get_pr(pr_number=PR_NUMBER)`
   → set `HEAD_BRANCH` and `BASE_BRANCH` from the result.
   → if either is null or missing, stop and report the blocker before proceeding.
   → if `state == "merged"` and `merged_at` is not null, the PR is already merged:
     skip step 2 and go directly to step 3.

2. **Merge**
   `merge_pr(pr_number=PR_NUMBER)`
   → authoritative host-side merge signal. Do not use `git_diff_stat` as a substitute.
   → if the tool returns an error, stop and report; do not proceed to step 3.

3. **Capture post-merge metadata**
   `get_pr(pr_number=PR_NUMBER)`
   → called again because `merge_sha` is only populated after a completed merge.
   → set `MERGE_SHA` and `PR_BODY` from the result.
   → if `merged_at` is null or `MERGE_SHA` is null, stop and report; the merge did not complete.

4. **Return to parent branch**
   `git_checkout(branch=BASE_BRANCH)`
   → required before reachability verification and branch cleanup.

5. **Pull parent branch**
   `git_pull()`
   → brings `MERGE_SHA` into the local parent branch history.
   → if pull fails, stop and report; do not proceed to cleanup.

6. **Verify the merge commit is reachable**
   `check_merge(merge_sha=MERGE_SHA)`
   → confirms `MERGE_SHA` is present in the current branch history after pull.
   → if the result says the SHA is not reachable, stop and report; do not delete the branch.
   → do not substitute raw terminal git commands for this check.

7. **Load parent-branch coordination context**
   `get_work_context()`
   → set `PARENT_WORKFLOW` and `PARENT_ISSUE` if the result contains them.
   → if context is empty or does not load (expected on `main` and stateless branches),
     set `PARENT_WORKFLOW = ""` and `PARENT_ISSUE = ""` and continue; this is not an error.
   → do not use this call to look up PR metadata or child-branch state.

8. **Delete the closing branch**
   `git_delete_branch(branch=HEAD_BRANCH, mode="both")`
   → deletes both local and remote tracking refs in one step.
   → if the remote ref is already absent, `mode="both"` handles it silently; no retry needed.

9. **Process PR body closeout facts**
   Use `PR_BODY` captured in step 3. No additional tool call needed.
   Identify and note: delivered scope, `Closes #N` claims, deferred items, and
   any explicit non-closure rationale. This is the authoritative `@imp` → `@co` transfer artifact.

10. **Epic-parent update (conditional)**
    Execute only when `PARENT_WORKFLOW` is a tracked epic workflow.
    Skip silently when `PARENT_WORKFLOW` is `""` (e.g. `main` is the parent branch).
    `update_issue(issue_number=PARENT_ISSUE, body=<updated coordination state>)`
    → update with: merged PR reference, delivered scope summary, deferred items, and next issue.
    → if `PARENT_ISSUE` is `""` but `PARENT_WORKFLOW` is non-empty, stop and report the blocker.

11. **Next-issue recommendation (advisory)**
    Based on `PR_BODY` facts and current epic or backlog state, recommend the next
    logically following issue to the human.
    Do not trigger tool calls or priority mutations without explicit human confirmation.

## Recovery: Issue Still Open After Merge

Apply this block only when all three conditions hold:
1. `PR_BODY` contains a `Closes #N` claim
2. the merge is confirmed complete (`MERGE_SHA` is set)
3. the referenced issue is still open on GitHub

If `ISSUE_NUMBER` is not available, parse it from the `Closes #N` claim in `PR_BODY`.

```
close_issue(issue_number=ISSUE_NUMBER, comment="Closed via merged PR #PR_NUMBER")
```

`close_issue` is a recovery action only. It is not part of the normative sequence above.

## Guardrails

- Do not merge without explicit human invocation of this prompt.
- `merge_pr` is the only authoritative merge signal; `git_diff_stat` is not.
- `check_merge` is the only permissible reachability gate before branch deletion; raw git commands are not.
- Do not use `get_work_context()` as a source of PR or child-branch metadata.
- Do not call `close_issue` unless all three recovery conditions above are met.

## Output

Report after completing or stopping:
- PR number, merge result, and `MERGE_SHA`
- `HEAD_BRANCH` deleted, `BASE_BRANCH` used for checkout
- reachability result from `check_merge`
- branch cleanup result from `git_delete_branch`
- epic-parent update result (when applicable)
- next-issue recommendation (when relevant)
