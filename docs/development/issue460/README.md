# Issue 460 Pre-Implementation Documentation Contract

**Status:** DEFINITIVE — DOCUMENTATION CONTRACT; DESIGN ACTIVE  
**Version:** 1.25
**Last Updated:** 2026-09-12  

---

## Purpose

This issue-local contract defines the required structure, ownership, traceability, and
lifecycle of the Research and Design documentation for issue #460. It exists to keep a
large pre-implementation evidence and decision set navigable without creating a
monolithic Design document or duplicating authority across files.

## Current Review Boundary

The current Research gate is the [2026-09-11 example-validation withdrawal](research.md#example-validation-withdrawal--2026-09-11).
The human reported independent QA clean GO and authorized Design resumption. Research
remains frozen. The human supplied independent QA GO without P0–P3 findings for the
W07/W08 concrete-template contracts on 2026-09-11; this does not imply whole-Design
completion or finished integration. The [Design hub](design.md)
owns current package status; earlier amendment statuses are historical, not active stops.

W06 schema closeout was human-approved on 2026-09-12: DI-01/02 §7.2.3 owns JSON Schema
2020-12 semantics and contained static reference resolution; Shared §7.6 owns the
active-catalog schema URI without fingerprint. The Shared Contracts document is
included intentionally in this canonical consolidation, not left as temporary review
material. The accepted W04 test configuration/request/result graph is now consolidated
in DI-05 §§7.15.1–7.15.5. Cross-package wrapper/serialization, disposition coverage and
review remain open. No runtime/client conformance or whole-Design QA GO is implied.

The [integration review](design-integration-review.md) records the source-based
151-test/helper dispositions, supplemental seams and remaining output-contract gaps.
Prepared input/attachment/capture transport is now specified in its canonical owners;
declarative consumer result presentation and exact mutation/check error-detail matrices
still require Design completion before the combined whole-phase review.

## Scope

### In Scope

- the topology and responsibility of every Research and Design document for issue #460;
- the distinction between navigation, evidence, decisions, contracts, and review history;
- mandatory section and traceability rules for Design documents;
- the collaboration workflow used to draft, integrate, and review Design decisions;
- conflict resolution and change control inside the pre-implementation set.

### Out of Scope

- implementation code, production migrations, and concrete implementation sequencing;
- Planning cycles, commit boundaries, and task estimates;
- repeating evidence inventories already owned by the Research documents;
- deferred feature work excluded by [Deferred Work](deferred-work.md);
- [startup health and recovery](deferred-work.md#deferred-work-notice-agent-facing-startup-health-and-recovery) explicitly deferred during Design: no health logic, health-first policy, or new health-driven blockades in issue 460; complete availability-aware check/test/fix inputs remain in scope, independently of that future issue;
- repository-wide documentation conventions beyond issue #460.

## Contract Position

This README is the **form and navigation authority** for issue #460 pre-implementation
documentation. It does not replace the content authority of Research or Design.

The authority order is:

1. the active phase instructions returned by `get_work_context` govern the current
   workflow actions;
2. [Architecture Principles](../../coding_standards/ARCHITECTURE_PRINCIPLES.md) and
   [Documentation Standard](../../coding_standards/DOCUMENTATION_STANDARD.md) remain
   binding;
3. [Research](research.md) owns the Research gate, invariants, expected results, and
   Approved Strategy;
4. Research companion documents own their named evidence, inventories, exclusions, and
   Design intake;
5. the planned `design.md` owns Design rationale, integration status, decision
   navigation, and whole-set coverage;
6. each Design package document owns the exact decisions and contracts assigned to it
   below;
7. Planning will later own implementation order, cycles, and deliverable scheduling.

A summary may point to an authoritative decision, but may not restate it as a second
source of truth.

## Research Documentation Structure

Research was reopened on 2026-09-04 by explicit human direction. Design investigation established that the approved F-19 validation/check boundary would still leave behavioral testing and fixing in separate Python-oriented extension architectures. F-20 therefore adds one language-agnostic adapter extension suite with separate versioned check/test/fix role contracts, clean-break PGMCP 3.0 tool/configuration vocabulary, bounded fix application, adapter ownership/trust/version/fingerprinting, and independent conformance evidence.

The F-20 Research amendment is complete. Independent QA preserved its substantive direction through two census-only NOGOs; the final hidden-aware repository-root correction records 126 consumers plus two separately excluded governing-standard sources and 151 tests/helpers, including explicit ownership for `pyproject.toml`, root `README.md`, and the generated VS Code/Copilot coordination-agent variant. Following closure of the targeted gate, the human owner formally authorized Design on 2026-09-04. Research is now content-frozen. New product roles, compatibility choices, or consumer families require a separate issue.

| Document | Authority and Responsibility |
|---|---|
| This README | Form, topology, navigation, and ownership rules for the pre-implementation set |
| [research.md](research.md) | Canonical Research conclusion, Approved Strategy, invariants, expected results, gate status, and Research hand-over |
| [research-findings.md](research-findings.md) | Detailed findings, evidence, implications, and design obligations |
| [template-suite-catalog.md](template-suite-catalog.md) | Complete public artifact, suite-file, consumer, and test/helper inventories and dispositions |
| [probe-evidence.yaml](probe-evidence.yaml) | Reproducible structured probe observations; evidence rather than policy |
| [deferred-work.md](deferred-work.md) | Explicit exclusions and post-issue work that Design must not absorb |
| [design-intake-map.md](design-intake-map.md) | Authoritative routing from findings, strategies, invariants, expected results, consumers, and removals into DI-01–DI-08, XC-01–XC-02, and RC-01 |
| [research-to-design-qa-audit.md](research-to-design-qa-audit.md) | Independent point-in-time Research review history, both F-20 census-only NOGOs and remediations, and the later human-confirmed formal Design GO |
| [validation-quality-gates-brainstorm-handover.md](validation-quality-gates-brainstorm-handover.md) | Historical exploratory input for the validation/quality boundary; not a current gate or Design authority |

Research documents retain detailed ledgers. Design documents reference their stable IDs
and source sections instead of copying those ledgers.

## Design Documentation Structure

Design uses a hub-and-spoke structure. The hub integrates the phase; the package
documents own the detailed decisions. Files marked **planned** are created only when the
corresponding workshop has produced a stable decision nucleus.

| Document | Design Ownership | Initial Status |
|---|---|---|
| `design.md` | Thin Design hub: rationale, package register, dependency and decision indexes, whole-set coverage, integration risks, and Design hand-over | Planned |
| `design-shared-contracts.md` | Exact interfaces, DTOs, configuration shapes, status vocabularies, and interaction rules genuinely shared by multiple package documents | Planned |
| `design-suite-resolution.md` | DI-01 suite contract metamodel and public schema exposure; DI-02 resolved graph, runtime selection, introspection, and provenance | Planned |
| `design-mutation-validation.md` | DI-04 scaffold/safe-edit mutation, persistence policy, atomicity, recovery, and consumption of unchanged DI-05 factual check evidence | Existing draft; resume in Design |
| [design-execution-adapters.md](design-execution-adapters.md) | DI-05 adapter package/catalog/process architecture; separate check, test, and fix contracts and operations; fix authorization; V3 cutover; conformance and migration evidence | Drafting; manifest nucleus decided; shared check binding/profile workshop open; complete launch contracts and migration open |
| [design-document-tracking-artifacts.md](design-document-tracking-artifacts.md) | DI-03 contracts and renderer semantics for documentation, issue, PR, commit, planning, validation-report, and related tracking artifacts | Decided; bounded QA GO reported; integration pending |
| [design-code-test-artifacts.md](design-code-test-artifacts.md) | DI-03 contracts and renderer semantics for production-code and public unit/integration-test artifact families | Decided; bounded QA GO reported; integration pending |
| `design-distribution.md` | DI-06 package distribution, renewal, customization, adoption, and owner-deployment migration | Planned |
| [design-workflow-documentation.md](design-workflow-documentation.md) | DI-07 workflow semantics, phase-document carriers, agent-instruction alignment, and active documentation authority | Human-approved; combined independent review pending |
| [design-test-architecture.md](design-test-architecture.md) | DI-08 shared repository test fixtures/helpers and cross-package assurance; XC-02 removal-completeness integration | Human-approved; canonical audit and independent review pending |

### Binding Design and Planning Manageability Conditions

1. Research is content-frozen; a new product role, compatibility choice, or consumer family requires a separate issue.
2. DI-05 remains in `design-execution-adapters.md`; it is not merged into DI-04 scaffolding/mutation design.
3. Planning decomposes DI-05 and consumer migration into multiple independently provable cycles; no DI-05 mega-cycle or catch-all remaining-consumers/tests cycle is permitted.
4. Adapter contracts, catalog resolution, and independent conformance evidence exist before legacy runners and parsers are removed.
5. Check, test, and fix migrations are proven separately.
6. F-10 renewal activation and F-20 fix application occur in separate implementation cycles.
7. Public V3 cutover follows proven internal routes. Intermediate new/legacy code coexistence creates no supported dual-read or alias contract.
8. Every cycle has a bounded write set, explicit preserved behavior, its own rollback point, and independent stop/go evidence.
9. Planning assigns each of the 126 consumers and 151 tests/helpers to a concrete cycle owner.

### Boundary Between the Two Test Concerns

The distinction is normative:

- public scaffolded test artifact contracts belong to
  `design-code-test-artifacts.md` under DI-03;
- repository test fixtures, helper APIs, reusable test architecture, and cross-package
  removal assurance belong to `design-test-architecture.md` under DI-08;
- DI-01–DI-07 retain ownership of their package-specific behavioral evidence, migration
  tests, and concrete removals even when they consume DI-08 infrastructure.

## Document Ownership Rules

1. Every decision and exact contract has one authoritative owner.
2. `design-shared-contracts.md` owns only contracts consumed by more than one package.
   Package-local interfaces and representations stay in the owning package document.
3. A consuming document links to a shared or upstream contract and records its local
   consequence; it does not reproduce the contract.
4. `design.md` records decision status and integration consequences but does not become
   a second detailed design.
5. The [Design Intake Map](design-intake-map.md) remains authoritative for package
   routing. A Design document may refine a boundary but may not silently move ownership.
6. XC-01 and RC-01 apply as binding constraints throughout. XC-02 is integrated through
   the owning package documents and audited by DI-08.
7. Conditional catalog dispositions must be resolved in their owning Design package,
   not left as unassigned Planning work.
8. Deferred work is linked, not redesigned.
9. No Design document may introduce a compatibility strategy that conflicts with the
   Approved Strategy. New evidence that invalidates it stops the affected design thread
   and reopens the decision explicitly.

## Required Design Document Contract

Every detailed Design document must contain the following sections. A section that is
not applicable is retained with a short rationale rather than silently omitted.

1. **Purpose and Authority** — the exact decisions the document owns.
2. **Scope and Exclusions** — included boundaries, consumers, and deliberate exclusions.
3. **Binding Inputs** — linked findings, Approved Strategy rows, invariants, expected
   results, intake obligations, Architecture Principles, and upstream contracts.
4. **Owned Decisions** — a concise decision register with stable local IDs and status.
5. **Responsibilities and Boundaries** — production and test responsibilities, ownership,
   dependencies, and composition-root placement.
6. **Options and Rationale** — materially viable alternatives, trade-offs, chosen option,
   and rejected options.
7. **Detailed Design** — exact components, interfaces, DTOs, configuration, schemas,
   status semantics, and algorithms owned by the document.
8. **Control, Data, and State Flow** — success, failure, unavailable, and
   not-executed paths where applicable.
9. **Compatibility, Migration, and Removal** — preservation or clean-break behavior,
   cutover, concrete legacy removals, and absence-of-old-path proof.
10. **Test and Validation Design** — package-owned behavioral evidence, shared DI-08
    dependencies, self-hosting risks, and independent proof obligations.
11. **Integration Risks and Open Questions** — only unresolved Design work; no hidden
    implementation TODOs.
12. **Planning Consequences** — deliverable boundaries and ordering constraints without
    defining Planning cycles.
13. **Traceability Matrix** — exact coverage of owned DI/XC/RC obligations, findings,
    strategy rows, invariants, expected results, consumers, and conditional dispositions.
14. **Related Documentation and Version History**.

Each detailed document header must also state its primary DI package or packages,
upstream dependencies, downstream consumers, and lifecycle status.

## The Design Hub Contract

The planned `design.md` remains deliberately thin. It owns:

- the overall Design rationale and selected document topology;
- a package-status register using `Not started`, `Drafting`, `Decided`, or
  `Integrated`;
- the dependency order and cross-document integration decisions;
- a decision index that points to the exact owning document and section;
- consolidated coverage accounting for all 22 findings, 44 Approved Strategy rows,
  19 invariants, 23 expected results, DI-01–DI-08, XC-01–XC-02, and RC-01;
- unresolved conflicts, integration risks, and the final Design hand-over.

It does not own copied component designs, repeated inventories, implementation cycles,
or a second rendering of package-local contracts.

## Traceability Rules

- Use the existing `F-*`, `I-*`, `E-*`, `DI-*`, `XC-*`, and `RC-*`
  identifiers; do not invent aliases for the same obligation.
- Identify Approved Strategy rows by their existing finding/strategy wording and link to
  the canonical table.
- Every Design decision has one local stable ID and one owning section.
- Every detailed Design document ends with an explicit coverage matrix.
- `design.md` aggregates coverage by reference and flags gaps or duplicate ownership;
  it does not copy the detailed matrices.
- Inventory totals and file ledgers are read from the Research owners. Design records
  only dispositions and impacts that it owns.
- A requirement is covered only when the document defines the resulting structure,
  behavior, or proof obligation. A bare link is navigation, not coverage.

## Hands-On Collaboration Workflow

Design proceeds as a sequence of bounded workshops:

1. select one coherent package boundary and load only its authoritative Research inputs;
2. agree interactively on the problem framing, alternatives, and stable decision
   nucleus;
3. scaffold the owning Design document once that nucleus is stable;
4. refine the document through small reviewed edits, keeping exact contracts with their
   single owner;
5. update the `design.md` decision, dependency, status, and coverage indexes;
6. run a cross-document consistency check before declaring the package `Integrated`;
7. repeat for the next package in dependency order;
8. perform a final whole-set traceability, removal, and contradiction audit before the
   independent Design review.

This lets the user shape decisions hands-on without requiring the entire Research corpus
or the entire Design set to be rewritten in every conversational step.

For W07/W08 the human explicitly delegated bounded template/schema choices on 2026-09-11.
The producer designs from Research plus correct existing behavior, records preservation
and removal dispositions, and submits the two coordinated documents to independent QA.
Field-by-field human approval is not required for this batch. This does not authorize
new Research strategy, implementation, or producer-issued review approval.

## Recommended Workshop Order

The default order follows dependency pressure rather than filename order:

1. Reconcile the Design hub and shared contract vocabulary with the frozen F-20 intake.
2. Complete DI-01/DI-02 suite contract and resolved-graph design.
3. Complete DI-03 concrete artifact contracts across its two documents.
4. Create and workshop the dedicated DI-05 execution-adapter document: package/catalog/process first, then separate check, test, and fix contracts, operations, conformance evidence, and migration boundaries.
5. Reconcile DI-04 mutation policy around unchanged DI-05 factual check evidence, then complete DI-08 shared test architecture and XC-02 assurance.
6. Complete DI-06 distribution and migration without combining F-10 renewal activation with F-20 fix application.
7. Complete DI-07 workflow/documentation alignment after public decisions stabilize.
8. Perform cross-package integration, verify the downstream Planning decomposition constraints, and prepare the final Design hand-over.

The order may change when new evidence requires it, but ownership does not change
implicitly.

## Conflict and Change Protocol

When two documents disagree:

1. stop work on the affected dependent decision;
2. identify the authoritative owner using this README and the Design Intake Map;
3. update the owning document first;
4. record downstream consequences in each consumer without duplicating the contract;
5. update the `design.md` indexes and coverage;
6. explicitly reopen human approval if the Approved Strategy would change.

Changes to this README that alter document ownership, topology, or the required document
contract require explicit human agreement. Routine link, status, and version-history
maintenance does not.

## Completion Criteria

The pre-implementation documentation contract is satisfied when:

- Research gate status matches the canonical Research artifact, including any active amendment review;
- every Research artifact has a single stated responsibility;
- every Design package and cross-cutting obligation has one detailed owner;
- all detailed Design documents conform to the required section contract;
- the Design hub proves complete, non-duplicated traceability;
- cross-document contracts have one authority and all consumers link to it;
- no historical reservation is presented as an active gate;
- no deferred, Planning, or implementation work is silently absorbed into Design.
