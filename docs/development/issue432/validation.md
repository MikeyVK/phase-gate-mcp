# Validation Report - Bug #432 Graceful Server Initialization

**Status:** APPROVED  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Last Updated:** 2026-07-19  
**Validation Outcome:** PASS  
**Issue:** #432  

---

## 1. Scope and Prerequisites

### 1.1. Validation Scope
This validation report verifies the implementation of Bug #432: "Graceful Server Initialization and Config Validation". The goal is to ensure the server gracefully starts in a degraded mode (exposing only `health_check` containing diagnostic error information) upon encountering domain configuration errors (e.g. invalid YAML files, missing configurations, version mismatches). It also verifies template version validation is decoupled from global boot and handled locally within `TemplateScaffolder`.

### 1.2. Prerequisites & Preconditions
- The configuration file `.pgmcp/config/artifacts.yaml` must be present and initially healthy.
- The server boots normally under valid configuration.

## 2. Summary Verdict

**Verdict:** **PASS**

All planned deliverables have been fully implemented, verified via automated test suites (2715 passing tests), verified via branch-wide quality gates, and verified manually via live boot scenarios.

## 4. Deliverables Mapping & Observed Evidence

| Deliverable ID | Requirement / Goal | Observed Evidence & Test Cases | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| `c1-scaffolder-update` | Early template version validation in scaffolder. | `ValidationError` is thrown in `TemplateScaffolder.validate()` if versions mismatch. | **Satisfied** |
| `c1-test-scaffolder` | Unit tests for template version mismatch. | `test_validate_fails_when_template_version_mismatch` in `test_template_scaffolder.py`. | **Satisfied** |
| `c2-health-tool-update` | Support injected overrides for status/reason in `HealthCheckTool`. | `override_status` and `override_reason` parameters in constructor of `HealthCheckTool`. | **Satisfied** |
| `c2-test-health-tool` | Unit tests for health tool overrides. | `test_health_check_tool_with_injected_override` in `test_health_tools.py`. | **Satisfied** |
| `c3-cli-update` | Catch config errors on boot and start `DegradedMCPServer`. | Exception handling in `cli.py` and definition of `DegradedMCPServer` in `server.py` containing only the `health_check` tool. | **Satisfied** |
| `c3-test-cli` | Unit/integration tests for CLI degraded boot. | `test_cli_degraded_server_on_config_error` in `test_cli.py`. | **Satisfied** |

## 5. Corrected Behavior, Regression, and Strategy Alignment

### 5.1. Corrected Behavior
- **Before:** When a configuration file (like `artifacts.yaml`) had a syntax error or a version mismatch, the bootstrap sequence threw a raw exception, causing the `stdio` connection to close abruptly and leaving the agent with a dead transport channel.
- **After:** The CLI catches `ConfigError`/`FileNotFoundError` and boots a `DegradedMCPServer`. The connection stays alive. The agent can invoke `health_check` to receive the diagnostic reason (e.g. version mismatches) and tell the user how to fix it.

### 5.2. Regression Alignment
- The normal startup path remains unchanged: if the configuration files are valid, `cli.py` spawns the fully featured `MCPServer` containing all MCP tools.
- Scaffolding of valid templates continues to function normally.

### 5.3. Approved Strategy Alignment
- **Config-First:** Preserved `Literal["1.0.0"]` schema tag versioning rules.
- **Fail-Fast:** True infrastructure errors (like binding issues or network faults) are **not** caught by `cli.py` and will still result in a crash, satisfying the fail-fast principle.
- **No Complex Tools in Degraded Mode:** Exposing `RestartServerTool` in degraded mode was reverted and completely removed to prevent exposing complex/destructive capabilities when enforcement policies and configurations are broken.

## 6. Live Demonstration Proposal

### 6.1. Steps to Reproduce and Verify
1. **Initial Health Check:**
   - Execute `health_check` -> Observe status is `healthy`.
2. **Introduce Config Mismatch:**
   - Edit `.pgmcp/config/artifacts.yaml` to set `version: 2.0.0`.
3. **Trigger Restart:**
   - Restart the IDE or restart the server process.
4. **Degraded Health Check:**
   - Execute `health_check` -> Observe status is `unhealthy` and reason is `"Config version mismatch in artifacts.yaml: expected version '1.0.0', found '2.0.0'. Please update your configuration."`
5. **Restore Configuration:**
   - Edit `.pgmcp/config/artifacts.yaml` to restore `version: 1.0.0`.
6. **Trigger Restart:**
   - Restart the IDE or restart the server process -> Observe server returns to `healthy`.

## 7. Residual Risks, Caveats, and Follow-up Items

- **Process Restart in Degraded Mode:** Because `RestartServerTool` is excluded from the degraded mode, manual intervention (IDE restart or process kill) is necessary to restart the server after fixing the configuration files. This is the desired behavior to ensure security and prevent bypass of the enforcement architecture.
- **Upgrade Paths:** Automatic upgrades/migrations when version mismatches occur remain deferred as tech debt (referenced in #429).
